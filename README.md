# ML_Project34-CNNImageClassifier

### CNN Image Classifier with PyTorch
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. It's designed to be clear, concise, and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning CNNs or PyTorch.

### Project Overview
This CNN is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset containing 60,000 images of 10 different classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, etc.). The model learns to extract features from images and classify them into the appropriate class.

### Key Features:
Modular Design: The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns between data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation.

Detailed Explanations: Comments are included throughout the code to explain each step, making it easy to understand the implementation.

Best Practices: The code adheres to best practices for CNN training, including using a validation set and leveraging GPUs for faster training (if available).

Device Agnostic: The code can be run seamlessly on CPU or GPU by automatically moving the model and data to the available hardware.


### Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/)
torchvision (included with PyTorch installation)

### Instructions:

###### Clone this repository.

###### Install the required libraries:
```
pip install torch torchvision
```

###### Run the main script:
```
python main.py
```

This will download the CIFAR-10 dataset, train the CNN model, and display the training progress and evaluation results on the validation set.

### Project Structure
###### Here's a breakdown of the project structure:
cifar10_dataset.py: Handles data loading and preprocessing for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
cnn_model.py: Defines the CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully-connected layers.
train_utils.py: Contains helper functions for training, validation, and evaluation.
main.py: The main script that orchestrates the entire training process.

### Further Exploration
Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., deeper networks, different activation functions).

Try training the model on different image classification datasets.

Explore techniques like data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning for potentially better performance.

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and building CNN image classifiers using PyTorch. Feel free to explore the code further, modify it to your needs, and leverage it as a stepping stone for your own deep learning projects.
